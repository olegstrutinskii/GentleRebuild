    <p><b>GentleRebuild</b> is Powershell script for online index rebuild in
      high-load clustered MSSQL databases working 24/7 - <b>Enterprise Edition
      </b>is expected, Standard Edition is not supported. Script executes <strong>ALTER
        INDEX ... REBUILD</strong> in a safe controlled mode using 2 threads:
      one thread is executing the command while second one is checking the
      environment for several conditions. What is controlled:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Too active index rebuild activity can overflow the <b>LDF</b> file -
        transaction log backup could be not fast enough to flush the generated
        log to the disk</li>
      <li>High index rebuild activity can fill <b>AlwaysOn</b> queues (Send and
        Redo) above safe thresholds</li>
      <li>Or, despite the ONLINE option, rebuild can block other processes via
        schema locks - in such cases script "yields", stopping it work
        temporarily</li>
      <li>Controlled deadline time - deadline is a time when script should stop
        (not to interfere with the other important processes running on a fixed
        schedule)</li>
      <li>Exception list of tables and indexes - schemas named 'import', 'tmp',
        tables named 'tmp_%' etc.</li>
      <li>Indexes which can't be rebuilt with the options <b>RESUMABLE=ON</b>
        or even <b>ONLINE=ON </b>- such case indexes are skipped when size is
        above the defined thresholds</li>
      <li>Limits the maximum duration of continuous index rebuild </li>
      <li>Limits the maximum size of indexes rebuild during a single run - in
        case the amount of total space for transaction log backups is limited or
        logs are used to roll over to STANDBY databases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>SQL server script<br>
      </strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Execute script <strong>FRG_install.sql</strong> on a "DBA" database.
        In almost any environment there is dedicated "DBA" database - DBA,
        SYSSYS, Optimization, names differ. In the worse case, if there is no
        such database, use msdb.</li>
      <li>Execute procedure <strong>FRG_FillSizeStats</strong> to fill a table
        with object list and sizes. This procedure usually finishes it's work it
        few seconds</li>
      <li>Execute procedure<strong> FRG_FillFragmentation</strong> to analyze a
        level of fragmentation. Default mode is the fastest one, '<strong>LIMITED</strong>',
        however, it could take up to a day to analyze 30-100Tb. This is why
        powershell program doesn't analyze the fragmentation level during it's
        run, but relies on the previously collected information. First parameter
        of this stored procedure allows you to limit the analysis by a single
        database. By defaul all non system databases are analyzed.</li>
      <li>When script finishes the index rebuild, it updates the size and
        fragmentation info using the stored procedure <strong>FRG_FillFragmentationOne</strong>.
        Typically fragmentation level drops below the threshold, so on the next
        run an index won't be affected</li>
      <li>Powershell script relies on the static previously collected
        information, not on the actual fragmentation level NOW. (which can
        gradually deteriorate after an analysis). This is why steps 2 and 3
        should be executed again from time to time.</li>
      <li>Underlying tables keep all the history of sizes and fragmentation
        levels, the last value can be selected from a view <strong>FRG_last</strong>:</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Powershell Script parameters<br>
      </strong></p>
    <p>When you run powershell script, supply a configuration file name as first
      parameter, for example:</p>
    <p><em>powershell .\GentleRebuild.ps1 param</em></p>
    <p>where param.frg - is JSON files with parameters, for example:</p>
    <p><em>{</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; server: "myServer",</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; dbname: "db1,db2,anotherDb",</em></p>
    <p><em>&nbsp; allowNonResumable: 50,</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; allowNonOnline: 10,</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; threshold: 40,</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; extrafilter: " and SchemaName not in ('tmp','import') and
        page_count&gt;100 and TotalSpaceMb&lt;1000000",</em></p>
    <p><em>&nbsp; deadline: "23:00",</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; rebuildopt: "DATA_COMPRESSION=PAGE,MAXDOP=2",</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; columnstoreopt: "MAXDOP=1",</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; relaxation: 30,</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; maxlogused: 200000,</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; maxlogusedpct: 0,</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; maxqlen: 25000,</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; maxdailysize: 1000000,</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; chunkminutes: 0,</em><br>
      <em>&nbsp; workdb: "DBA"</em><br>
      <em>}</em></p>
    <p><br>
      <b>All parameters in detail:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where and what to rebuild:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>server</strong> - server name (Integrated Security is
            used, if you do need SQL login edit the ps1 file)</li>
          <li><strong>dbname</strong> - Database name to defragement. You can
            provide comma separated list. * means all non-system databases.</li>
          <li><strong>workdb</strong> - DBA database (see above)</li>
          <li><strong>threshold</strong> - fragmentation threshold in percent.</li>
          <li><strong>extrafilter</strong> - Additional filter, which is applied
            against FRG_last view. Useful filter examples:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>page_count&gt;100 to skip tiny tables. Even after rebuild they
                could be too fragmented because they don't have enough pages to
                be completely populated</li>
              <li>TotalSpaceMb&lt;1000000 - Skip huge indexes, they need extra
                care.</li>
              <li>exceptions by SchemaName, Tablename, IndexName etc</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>AllowNonResumable</strong> - size in Gb. If an index can't
            be rebuilt using <b>RESUMABLE=ON</b>, an attempt is made to rebuild
            it with <b>ONLINE=ON</b>. However, in that case process can't be
            interrupted, and program can't yield to locks. This is why index
            should be small enough. It index size is bigger than that value it
            is skipped. Most HEAP indexes fall into that category.</li>
          <li><strong>AllowNonOnline</strong> - size in Gb. Some indexes can't
            be rebuilt even using <b>ONLINE=ON</b>. Then they are rebuild
            OFFLINE, locking other processes. They should be smaller than a
            threshold, or they are skipped. Obviously <strong>AllowNonOnline</strong>
            should be even smaller than <strong>AllowNonResumable&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>How to rebuild<br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>deadline</strong> - string in "HH:MM" format or an empty
            string. If current time is greater than deadline, tomorrow time is
            assumed. What deadline affects:
            <ul>
              <li>If deadline is reached, and there are still indexes to work
                on, process stops without starting a work on a next index</li>
              <li>If during a rebuild a projected time of completion (ETA) falls
                behind the deadline, and when work is between 2% and 3% (not far
                enough), then rebuild is terminated (using ABORT). However, it
                doesn't guarantee that work would always finish before the
                deadline, as process can slow down later. In such cases manual
                intervention is required (check "interactive menu")</li>
              <li>If ETA is behind the deadline, the progress messages are
                highlighted with yellow to attract an attention.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>rebuildopt </strong>- rebuild options for ordinary
            indexes (CLUSTERED, NONCLUSTERED, HEAP). Don't use MAX_DURATION, use
            <b>chunkminutes </b>instead. Regarding MAXDOP:
            <ul>
              <li>MAXDOP = 1 - slowly without much pressure on a server</li>
              <li>MAXDOP = 2 - normal work, recommended option</li>
              <li>MAXDOP = 4 - aggressive work</li>
              <li>It is not recommended to use MAXDOP&gt;4, you will reach the
                AlwaysOn limitations, and the process will be throttled</li>
              <li>Note: for some indexes MAXDOP is ignored and server uses 1-2
                threads no matter what MADOP is.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>columnstoreopt</strong> - similar options for COLUMNSTORE
            indexes (COLUMNSTORE index support is experimental)</li>
          <li><strong>relaxation</strong> - number of seconds process sleeps
            when throttled by throttling conditions (LDF use size, AlwaysOn
            queues, locking)</li>
          <li><strong>maxlogused</strong> - size in Mb used in log (LDF). When
            used space is greater than this value, script stops (throttles) for
            (relaxation) seconds and waits until the condition is cleared
            (transaction log backup carries away log). Value 0 means 'don't
            check'</li>
          <li><strong>maxlogusedpct</strong> - Same but in percent to the total
            size of transaction log. Value 0 means 'don't check. Typically one
            of these 2 conditions is verified.</li>
          <li><strong>maxqlen</strong> - Max size of AlwaysOn queues in Mb (log
            send queue + redo queue) for all databases. If value is above the
            threshold, process is throttled. To skip this check specify a very
            high value</li>
          <li><strong>maxdailysize</strong> - maximum work size of indexes
            rebuilt in Mb. Condition is verified when work on a new index is
            started. 0 means 'don't check'</li>
          <li><strong>chunkminutes</strong> - similar to MAX_DURATION, but is
            implemented using Powershell. 0 means no max duration, unless there
            are throttling conditions. Time is counted since last throttling.<strong><br>
            </strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Interactive menu</b></p>
    <p>By pressing Ctrl/C while script is progressing (not throttling) you enter
      an interactive menu (might take up to 15 seconds for the menu to appear):</p>
    <img src="interactivemenu.png" alt=""><br>
    <p>It displayes the current rebuild command and waits for a single character
      command. Don't leave it waiting for a command - it such state throttling
      conditions are not controlled. After command 'S' you can change the
      parameters and restart the script, it would continue from the same index.
      However MAXDOP can't be changed once rebuild is started.</p>
    <p><strong>Additional comments:<br>
      </strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Script starts from smaller indexes and is progressing towards the
        bigger ones</li>
      <li>Percentage is calculated based on the data in a table <b>index_resumable_operations</b>,
        if operation is with RESUMABLE option. Otherwise, there is a rough
        estimation based on the IO count vs page_count (rough estimation ... %).
        For COLUMNSTORE percentage is calculated based on the number of
        ROWSTOREs rebuilt.</li>
      <li>Sometimes after throttling the percentage doesn't increase and you
        will see ETA: (unknown). SQL server is seeking for a place from where to
        continue (rewinding effect). Sometimes it could take a long time </li>
      <li>You can check a global progress on a console title</li>
      <li>ETA for the global progress is calculated when at least 1% of the
        total work is done</li>
      <li>Don't leave indexes in a suspended resumable state. SQL server still
        has to track all the changes and some queries can run slower.</li>
      <li>Indexes in a stopped resumable state can fail over to another server,
        and rebuild can continue on another server (!!!)</li>
      <li>To track changes for ONLINE indexes, SQL has to change execution plans
        which update these table. In most cases there is only mild performance
        degradation, but in few cases (with MERGE) the difference could be
        dramatic</li>
      <li>Sometimes index rebuild can slow down processes even on unrelated
        databases for unknown reasons. Throttling or <b> chunkminutes </b>solves
        this problem. It is not known where the magic is, but looks like
        Microsoft knows something and had invented MAX_DURATION for that reason.</li>
      <li>If you chose <b>chunkminutes </b>too small the rebuild performance
        could suffer because of the "rewinding effect"</li>
      <li>COLUMNSTORE support is experimental.</li>
      <li>INDEX REORGANIZE is too slow for big tables (many Tb) and for
        COLUMNSTORE as well, this is why i focus on REBUILD only.</li>
